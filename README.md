# Coding-Examples

This Repo contains the code for a Shiny Application built while rotating with DoIT Research Cyberinfrastructure (RCI).

The purpose of the application is to show the usage of Posit Connect over time, and to evaluate the usage between different users.

The visualizations in the two tabs are organized by usage type. (Artifact Uploads & Artifact Access)

There are also a few image files demonstrating what the application shows when rendered.
